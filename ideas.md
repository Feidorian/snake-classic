# Algorithmic Representational View

1. Brute Force Approach
   1. Completely Randomized
2. Shortest Path (Manhattan distance)
3. Shortest Path with no self collisions
4. Shortest path with no self collision (random shortest path picking)
5. Hamiltonian cycles
   1. No cell visited more than once
   2. Zig-zag second row to last row across columns, then use first row to re-cycle back.
